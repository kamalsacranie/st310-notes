## Artificially inflating $R^{2}$ {#inflating-r-sq}

```{r, eval=T}
peng_lm_noise <- lm(
  body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm + species + noise1 + noise2 + noise3,
  # adding a vector of random numbers to our data using the mutate function
  data = penguins %>% mutate(
    noise1 = rnorm(n()),
    noise2 = rnorm(n()),
    noise3 = rnorm(n()),
  )
)
glance(peng_lm_noise)
```

The important takeaway is that the $R^{2}$ here is greater than the $R^{2}$
produced in section \@ref(penguin-multi-r-sq). This is why we need an adjusted
$R^{2}$ to negate the artificial inflation.  
Sometimes the adjusted $R^{2}$ can increase but on average it will account for
these added variables. I $R^{2}$ inflates because there are some correlations
between predictor variables even if very small. This means that more of the
variance will be explained by the mode eventhough it's not useful explanation?
